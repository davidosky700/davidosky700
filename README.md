## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nzelue David, a passionate frontend developer with a background in Statistics from the Federal University of Technology, Minna. My journey started in the world of data, but my curiosity and love for the digital landscape led me into web development. With hands-on experience in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js and SEO, I've built a range of projects from responsive websites to interactive user experiences.

Through dedicated self-study and practical application, Iâ€™ve gained the skills to create modern, user-friendly websites and applications that meet the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. My projects include various personal and professional works that showcase my ability to bring ideas to life in the digital space.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring new tech trends, enjoying outdoor activities, or diving into a good book. Iâ€™m always eager to connect, collaborate, and learn from others in the industry.

Ready to transform your vision into a digital reality? Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful together!
